# Matching Paths with []

## introduction
this problem builds on the last one, but instead of just matching the files, we have to match paths using `[]` here
## approach
- as stated we have to run the `/challenge/run` command with the paths to all relevant files as an argument
- since the `[]` checks with each element within the brackets, I took a similar approach as last time , but provided the absolute path this time
## code
```bash
Connected!
hacker@globbing~matching-paths-with-:~$ /challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[bash]
You got it! Here is your flag!
