# Permission Setting Practice
## Introduction
In this problem instead of adding or removing permissions,we just set like `chmod o=x /command` for example
## Approach
- I run `/challenge/run` to start the challenge
- I change permissions using some combination of `u,g,o` , `=` and `r,w,x` according to what needs to be changed
- I run `chmod u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rwx /flag` and then `cat /flag` to first make it readable and then retrieve the flag
## Code
```bash

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rwx /flag
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ cat /flag
