# Permission Tweaking Practice
## Introduction
This problem is a test of attention to detail, and the user's knowledge of changing permissions using tools that are taught till present
## Approach
- I run `/challenge/run`
- I change permissions using some combination of `u,g,o` , `+,-` and `r,w,x` according to what needs to be changed
## Code
```bash
Connected!
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ /challenge/run

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod o+r /flag
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ cat /flag
cat: /flag: Permission denied
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod u+r /flag
