# Intro to Arguments
This Problem is quite similar to `Intro to Commands` , However Instead of using just the `hello` command, we need to provide an additional argument in the form
of `hello hackers`

```bash
root@DESKTOP-MPJ395R:~# ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{E_XwX_eytZBoOaHgDc6q4-Zb-o8.dhjNyUDLzgTN0czW}
```
This Problem required me to build upon the concepts introduced in the last one
