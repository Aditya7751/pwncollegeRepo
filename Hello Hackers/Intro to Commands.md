# Intro to Commands
The Problem Prompted the User to enter the command `hello`

```bash
root@DESKTOP-MPJ395R:~# ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{UEfuHqrirR2EjDCkVbeCH5wQHlv.ddjNyUDLzgTN0czW}
```
This is how I solved this problem
