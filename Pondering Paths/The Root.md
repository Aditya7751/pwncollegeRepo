# The Root
This Problem Introduces the Concept of Absolute Paths, Paths Containing the Complete Address of a File Starting from the Root Directory ; Additionally We Are Instructed to Invoke the `pwn` program using its absolute path ,ie,`/pwn `

```bash
root@DESKTOP-MPJ395R:~# ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{ATyokDU_VDjhOr0_IqxoOwHwQ9K.dhzN5QDLzgTN0czW}
```
 `/ ` is the Root Directory
