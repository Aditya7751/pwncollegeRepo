# grepping for a needle in a haystack

This Problem Introduces the `grep` command, allowing us to search and manipulate strings

Given the hint that all flags contain pwn.college, I infer that is the keyword I want to look for
knowing that I execute `grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt`

```bash
Connected!
hacker@commands~grepping-for-a-needle-in-a-haystack:~$ grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt
pwn.college{Aucae5HiPbE17V5S2-cdvhjZppr.ddTM4QDLzgTN0czW}
```
