# removing files
In this Problem the `rm` command is introduced, which is used to remove files

As Instructed I use `rm delete_me` , following this I run `/challenge/check`

```bash
root@DESKTOP-MPJ395R:~# ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ rm delete_me
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ /challenge/check
Excellent removal. Here is your reward:
pwn.college{0OwkrU9lrEfW-ARd0tobJYqBez9.dZTOwUDLzgTN0czW}
```
