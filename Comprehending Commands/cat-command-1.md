# cat : not the pet, but the command!

In this problem we learn how to view the contents of a file using the `cat` command

As Instructed in the Problem I executed `cat flag` to retrieve the flag
```bash
Connected!
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{ME8V9D7Ci8zu0HkFSXK6B5v7Q8K.dFzN1QDLzgTN0czW}
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$
```
