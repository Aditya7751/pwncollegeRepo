# Level 5
## Approach
I use the find command with the `. -size` argument to match all files that have the size of 1033c, or 1033 bytes, I figured matching one criteria would be enough to get the flag
## Code
```bash
bandit5@bandit:~$
bandit5@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
bandit5@bandit:~$ cd inhere
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ ls
maybehere00  maybehere03  maybehere06  maybehere09  maybehere12  maybehere15  maybehere18
maybehere01  maybehere04  maybehere07  maybehere10  maybehere13  maybehere16  maybehere19
maybehere02  maybehere05  maybehere08  maybehere11  maybehere14  maybehere17
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find . -size 1033c
./maybehere07/.file2
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./maybehere07/.file2
