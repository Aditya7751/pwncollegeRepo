# Learning From Documentation

## Introduction:

Learning to access and read Documentation is key to finding out what a lot of programs we deal with do, and also for troubleshooting them

## Approach

As The Problem Suggested I used the `--giveflag` argument with `/challenge/challenge` to get the flag, with the overall command being `/challenge/challenge --giveflag`

## Code
```bash
root@DESKTOP-MPJ395R:~# ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
hacker@man~learning-from-documentation:~$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{IB5JkNx9_az3Ayf7bWkyDFq3ITz.dRjM5QDLzgTN0czW}
```
