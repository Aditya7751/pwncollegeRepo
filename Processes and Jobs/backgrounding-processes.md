# Backgrounding Processes
## Introduction
While processes can be resumed in the foreground using the `fg` command, they can also be resumed in the background using the `bg` command,a key difference is that resuming a process in the background lets you invoke other commands in the meanwhile
## Approach
- first I execute `/challenge/run` and then suspend it using Ctrl+z
- then I resume in the background using `bg`
- I then start another instance using `/challenge/run`, now I have two processes running and not suspended, thereby getting the flag
## Code
```bash
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running *and
not suspended* in this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID STAT CMD
root          82 S+   bash /challenge/run
root          84 R+   ps -o user=UID,pid,stat,cmd

I don't see a second me!

To pass this level, you need to suspend me, resume the suspended process in the
background, and then launch a new version of me! You can background me with
Ctrl-Z (and resume me in the background with 'bg') or, if you're not ready to
do that for whatever reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 /challenge/run
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$ bg
[1]+ /challenge/run &



Yay, I'm now running the background! Because of that, this text will probably
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt. Don't panic; just hit Enter a few times
to scroll this text out.
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running *and
not suspended* in this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID STAT CMD
root          82 S    bash /challenge/run
root          92 S    sleep 6h
root          93 S+   bash /challenge/run
root          95 R+   ps -o user=UID,pid,stat,cmd

Yay, I found another version of me running in the background
