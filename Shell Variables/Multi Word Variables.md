# Multi-Word Variables
## Introduction
This Problem builds upon the last one, explaining the syntax required for variables storing multi-word values
## Approach
- Similar to the Last Problem, I have to set COLLEGE YEAH as the value for PWN, but since it is 2 words, I have to use`"COLLEGE YEAH` when setting it, the overall expression is `PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"`
## Code
```bash
Connected!
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{kU7Igo1xz6AFLpM23p1lBNFS2jl.dBjN1QDLzgTN0czW}
```
