# Printing Variables
## Introduction
This Module is focused on teaching the basics of shell,a kind of programming language that allows us to interact with the linux command line interface, this problem focuses on printing variables
## Approach
- As the problem suggested I printed the `FLAG` variable using `echo $FLAG`
## Code 
```bash
root@DESKTOP-MPJ395R:~# ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{EtKmnXGMQ3ZRUY-LF8jsYBYlFfw.ddTN1QDLzgTN0czW}
```
