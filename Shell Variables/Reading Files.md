# Reading Files
## Introduction
Using Piping concepts we learned earlier, we can actually directly redirect a file into a variables std input
## Approach
- As the Problem suggested I executed `read PWN < /challenge/read_me` to redirect `/challenge/read_me` as input for `PWN`
## Code
```bash
Connected!
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN < /challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{UivQfZjFNTOB1daEINwTUcK_Ey8.dBjM4QDLzgTN0czW}
```
