# Setting Variables
## Introduction
While last problem had us printing variables, this one has us setting those variables to certain values
## Approach
- The Problem required us to assign COLLEGE as a value to PWN(case sensitive), so as the example suggested I went forward with `PWN=COLLEGE`
## Code
```bash
Connected!
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{4UlmNM0j1QrIAEMHic_uI6pTrNs.dlTN1QDLzgTN0czW}
```
